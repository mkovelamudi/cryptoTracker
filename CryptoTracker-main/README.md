# Cryptocurrency Market Tracker

### Problem Statement:-

In this ever growing world where there is something new everyday, cryptocurrency are the new hot topic. However it can get difficult to track all the cryptos and find out the top most cryptos according to market cap. We plan to make it simple by creating a webapp which is updated regularly and is tracking the latest status of the market.

### Abstract:-

There are over 10000 cryptocurrencies in the market currently and to keep a track of all of them is a tedious task. This problem can be resolved by having an app which will show the users the cryptos in the order of their market cap and have associating news for them. Also it would be much better if wer could help them connect to the relevant community of each currency so that they can talk to the community and take advice from them.

### Approach:-

We aim to create a web application using the data available by the Rapid API. The data we get from this API is live and is updating in real time. However this data is of not much use directly out of the box. It needs to be proceessed and converted to a form where the user can easily understand it. Meanwhile we also added the links to the various pages related to the crypto where the user can find more people and have conversation with them. Besides we are telling the user about the history of each crypto.

### Persona:-

Our main focus is on the new crypto investors who are new to the world of crypto . This is the group of people who have very little knoweledge about the crypto universe and need more information about the Latest trending currencies and news. As per PEW Research only 16% of people in america are actually invested in crypto currency. That means we have about 84% of population yet to realise the potential of crypto. Also among these 16% the majority age range in between 19 -29 years, which is very early to start with. Hence we aim at helping these young investors to know how to wisely invest in crypto by providing them the information about each coin and bringing them in contact with the crypto community.
